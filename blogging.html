    <p id="title">First Day At Google CSSI</p>
    <p id="entry">I was both nervous and excited for the first day.
      Nevous because I didn't really know anyone but excited
      because it's Google! The office tour was amazing.
      I don't know how people get their work done because
      I would be eating and in the game room all day. I am
      familar with the content we are learning today. It is
      helpful to me though that I am able to help my peers
      with the questions they have. I just wish I would have
      more energy but I can only blame myself for sleeping light.
      Can't wait until tomorrow</p>
